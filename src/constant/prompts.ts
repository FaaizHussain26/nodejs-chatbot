FAQ INFO:
1. A Murphy bed is a space-saving bed that folds up into a wall or cabinet, allowing you to maximize your floor space. 
The purpose of using Murphy bed hardware is that it operates on a set of gas pistons together with a pivot mechanism that makes it easy to pull down and lift back up. 
Our Murphy bed hardware is available in all popular mattress sizes like Queen, Full, Twin in vertical and horizontal style and King and California King sizes.
2. Our Murphy bed hardware kits include all the necessary hardware and parts to build install a functional Murphy bed, such as pistons, piston brackets, hinges, and all fasteners you will need to attach the hardware.
Detailed instructions are included along with 24/7 online step by step videos. You will also receive a cut-list guide to make measuring and cutting wood easy and quick.
3. Our regular hardware kits are available in both vertical mount and horizontal mount configurations that you can choose from for the sizes listed below:
Twin/Single Size- 39” X 75”
Full/Double Size- 54” X7 5”
Queen Size- 60” X 80”

King	82 1/4	88 1/4	16	85 1/4
California King	78 1/4	92 1/4	16	89 /14
Notes: Dimensions are finished cabinet exterior. Projection is cabinet front to folding leg edge when open. Keep mattress thickness ≤ 12″ for best clearance and if you want to use the optional leg cross bar.
5. After you measure your space, you should choose a kit based on the size and orientation of your bed (Vertical or Horizontal). Our kits are available for:
- Twin size mattress
- Full size mattress
- Queen size mattress
- King size mattress
- California King size mattress
6. After purchasing your murphy bed hardware, you will need to purchase the wood separately at a home improvement store.
We strongly recommend using veneered plywood to build your bed cabinet and solid wood for the inner wood bed frame. 
The wood and other materials you’ll need to purchase are all available at your local home improvement store and will cost around $300 to $550 depending on the bed you are building.
7. Depending on your skill level, the construction and assembly of a Murphy bed can take anywhere from 15 to 20 hours.
This includes time for measurements, cutting, assembling the frame, and installing the hardware. If you are painting or staining the lumber parts extra time may be required since recommend painting the lumber parts before you install the hardware metal parts.
8. If you use plywood, with proper installation and maintenance, your DIY Murphy bed can last for many years. The quality materials and durable hardware offered by Easy DIY Murphy Bed ensure long-lasting performance.
9. To build your own Murphy bed, you don’t need to be a master woodworker, but having some basic woodworking skills will help. Here’s what you should be comfortable with:
Measuring & Cutting: Accurate measurements are essential for ensuring that your bed frame and hardware fit together perfectly. You’ll need to be able to measure wood accurately and make straight cuts using a saw. You can also get the wood cut at your local hardware store.
Drilling & Screwing: You’ll need to drill holes for to attach the brackets, and pivot hardware. Being familiar with using a drill and screwdriver is important to build the frame and cabinet properly.
Construction & Assembly: The most important skill is being able to follow our detailed instructions. Our DIY Murphy bed kits come with easy-to-follow guides to help you put everything together, and step by step online videos.
Mounting: You’ll need to mount the bed frame to the wall, which will require installing wall anchors or lag bolts into the studs in the wall.  Understanding how to use a stud finder, impact drill or ratchet is important for safety.
Even if you’ve never tackled a woodworking project before, our kits are designed for DIYers like you. With patience and attention to detail, you can build your own high-quality Murphy bed! If you ever feel stuck, our customer support and video tutorials are here to guide you.
10. All the finished dimensions for all our Murphy bed sizes can be found on the finished dimensions page along with recommended mattress sizes.
11. The main difference between a vertical and horizontal Murphy bed lies in their orientation and how they close into the wall cabinet:
Vertical Murphy Bed: This style of cabinet folds up with the bed’s length going vertically. It’s perfect for smaller rooms where floor space is limited but you have more height to work with. When the bed is folded up, it typically takes up less wall space on the sides, making it a great choice for narrow rooms or spaces with regular height ceilings.
Horizontal Murphy Bed: This bed folds horizontally, with the bed’s width going up against the wall. It’s ideal for larger rooms or spaces where you have more wall width than height. Horizontal beds are often chosen when you have lower ceiling heights or want to add a TV on top.
Both options save space and offer great flexibility, but the choice depends on your room’s dimensions and how you want to use the space efficiently.
